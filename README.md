Android Auto Sources Sync

When you're waiting for a new android version to build it, you're on googlesource.com refreshing it every secs to sync it. No ? Oh sh_t, am I the only one ? 

Anywaym, if you're like me, there is a way to automatize it, I wrote a little python3 script to do the job : aass. We love aass.

You need to edit the script to make it work as you want. As example you can set the android ver to android-7.1.1_r1, it will check indefinitely if the version is available and when it'll be available, it'll download it.
